# Setup Guide for AGO Web Application

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the AGO web application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python**: Version 3.8 or later. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **pip**: Python package manager (comes with Python installation).
3. **Virtual Environment Tool**: `venv` or `virtualenv`.
4. **Git**: For cloning the repository. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)
5. **A Web Browser**: To view the application (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the AGO web application on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aimtyaem/AGO.git
cd AGO
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the necessary configuration variables. Below is an example:

```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

Make sure to replace `your_secret_key_here` with a secure key.

### Step 5: Initialize the Database

Run the following commands to apply migrations and set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 6: Start the Development Server

Start the web application locally using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Optional Steps

### Installing Additional Frontend Dependencies

If the project includes HTML/CSS/JavaScript dependencies, you might need `npm` or `yarn`. Check if there is a `package.json` file and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is working fine, you can run the test suite:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
- If you encounter issues related to database migrations, delete the `db.sqlite3` file and the `migrations` folder, then repeat Step 5.
- For additional help, refer to the project's [documentation](#) or open an issue in the repository.
